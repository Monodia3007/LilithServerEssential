# LilithServerEssential

This Plugin is a quick thing I made cause I was too lazy to search a plugin with /hub and to configure it

This plugin implements a /hub command which teleport the player using it to the world that has the name lobby.

To change the world it teleports to, go to the config.yml file and change lobby to whatever the plugin checks if the world exists when the command is used or type /sethub \<world-name> \<x> \<y> \<z>.

It also adds the possibility to use a command to teleport to a survival world of your choice
to modify the world use /setsurvivalworld \<world-name> \<x> \<y> \<z>
and to teleport to this world use /survivalworld
