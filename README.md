# LilithServerEssential

This Plugin is a quick thing I made cause I was to lazy to search a /hub and to configure it
This plugin implments a /hub command which teleport the player using it to the world that has the name lobby
I'll try to add a config file support so you can configure wich world it teleports the plyer to
