# LilithServerEssential

This Plugin is a quick thing I made cause I was to lazy to search a /hub and to configure it
This plugin implments a /hub command which teleport the player using it to the world that has the name lobby.
To change the world it teleports to, go to the config.yml file and change lobby to whatever the plugin checks if the world exists when the command is used.
